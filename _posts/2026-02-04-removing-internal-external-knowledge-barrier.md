title: Removing the barrier between internal and external knowledge

It's an idea I've pondered ever since beginning to place more external knowledge into my Obsidian vault, but I recently decided to do away with the lines that separated internal and external knowledge in my vault.
## Why would you do that?

You see, separating information like this never really felt like it could be done cleanly. Keeping a collection of information from other people tucked away into a single folder in my vault felt strange, especially as I wanted to organize resources in a similar manner as the rest of my vault.

Some of the resources I save for use in my vault includes notes/pages from other folks' digital gardens. It did not make sense for me personally to keep them in some kind of `Resources/` directory.

## What are the benefits and drawbacks of this?

Beyond making more sense to me in my head, it also somewhat detaches myself from the connections I make and things I write. I don't want to get caught up in just assuming that every insight I come across is true, and that an attack on it is an attack upon myself.

Many of my writings are inspired by works. Can I not be inspired by my own works as well?

The big drawback, of course, will be organizing it all. I'll have to mark the content that's written by me as, well, being written by me. Though once that's done, I can create templates for automation.
