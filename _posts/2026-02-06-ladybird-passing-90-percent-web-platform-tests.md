[Andreas Kling](https://twitter.com/awesomekling), the creator of the [Ladybird web browser](https://ladybird.org), has recently announced that the browser began to pass over 90% of [web platform tests](https://web-platform-tests.org/).[^ladybird-wpt-announcement][^5] This is a major milestone to reach because Apple has restrictions on the use of non-[WebKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit) browser engines on [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) and [iPadOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS), which prevents any [browser engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine) that doesn't pass 90% of tests to be used on the aforementioned platforms.[^apple-requirements][^ladybird-october-2025-newsletter]

Ladybird is unlikely to release any time soon, with the [alpha release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha) still planned for 2026, and a stable version likely years after that.[^ladybird] And so far, a port of Ladybird's browser engine to [mobile operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system) like [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), iOS, and iPadOS hasn't started in any significant capacity.[^ladybird]

Despite the challenges ahead of Ladybird, this milestone will make porting the browser engine to [Apple's ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_ecosystem) significantly easier, as, they no longer need to worry as much about Apple's alternative browser requirements, which Kling as called "arbitrary."[^ladybird-wpt-announcement]
