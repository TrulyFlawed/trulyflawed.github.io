	<h1>Contact</h1>
	<p>You might somehow want to talk or interact with me, so here's a few ways to do that.</p>
	
	<h2>Any of my socials</h2>
	<p>Firstly, you can contact me by interacting with me on any of my socials, really. Though I don't post very often, so good luck with that.</p>
	
	<h2>Matrix</h2>
	<p>Secondly, you could message me on Matrix at <code>@duskhasfallen:matrix.org</code></p>
	<p>Do note that I do not have any Spaces or Rooms for Matrix of my own (yet). All communication via Matrix will be one-to-one</p>
	
	<h2>Email</h2>
	<p>Finally, you can send me an email at <code>duskfall.personal@protonmail.com</code></p>
	<p>I am not a particularly huge fan of emails, as they feel incredibly clunky to use for me. But if it is most convenient for you, feel free to use it.</p>
