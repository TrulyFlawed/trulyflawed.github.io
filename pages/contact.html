	<h1>Contact</h1>
	<p>You might somehow want to talk or come into contact with me, so here's a few ways to do that.</p>
	<p>Firstly, you can contact me by interacting with me on any of my socials, really. Though I don't post very often, so good luck with that.</p>
	<p>Secondly, you could message me on Matrix at <code>@duskhasfallen:matrix.org</code>, or send me an email at <code>duskfall.personal@protonmail.com</code></p>
